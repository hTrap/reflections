What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
i need to make the first commit because git doesnt make any commits when the repository is initialised

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area is the middle place so that you ca commit all the files together in your repository.
By using git status it allows us to review the staging before making any final commit to the repository



How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add a ile to the staging  area and then commit it to the repository using git diff and git diff --stage
